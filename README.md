# Daily Problem Solving in Go

This repository is dedicated to solving a different coding problem every day using the Go programming language. The goal is to build a collection of daily problem-solving exercises, showcase solutions, and track progress. Each problem will be organized into its own folder within the `master` branch.

## How It Works

- Every day, a new coding problem will be solved using Go.
- Each problem will be placed in its own folder, named according to the day or problem number (e.g., `day-1-two-sum`, `day-2-fibonacci`).
- Once a solution is completed, it will be committed to the `master` branch.
- You can check the history of the repository to see the progress and solutions over time.
